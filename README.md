# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

Welcome to this exciting repository where we dive into the fundamentals of machine learning by building three key models from scratch: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes. This journey will enhance your understanding of the inner workings of these algorithms and provide a hands-on experience in machine learning.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find detailed implementations of:
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Delve into the world of deep learning by building a neural network from the ground up.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Explore this intuitive, instance-based learning method for classification and regression.
- **Naive Bayes**: Understand the simplicity yet effectiveness of probabilistic classifiers with Naive Bayes.

Each model is crafted with clear, explanatory code and comments to guide you through the process.

## Features

- **In-Depth Code Explanations**: Each line of code is accompanied by comments that explain the rationale behind it.
- **Visualizations**: Where applicable, visual aids are provided to help you understand the models better.
- **Example Datasets**: We use simple yet illustrative datasets to demonstrate the functionality of each model.
- **Performance Metrics**: After building each model, we evaluate its performance using standard metrics.
